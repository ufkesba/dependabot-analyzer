  "alert_number": 2,
  "package": "axios",
  "vulnerability_id": "GHSA-cph5-m8f7-6c5x",
  "is_exploitable": true,
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "The application uses axios version 0.21.1, which is vulnerable to ReDoS (Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity). The vulnerable code path is directly exposed via the `/api/fetch` endpoint (server.js:57). The input, `req.body.url`, is completely controlled by the attacker and is passed directly to `axios.get(url)` without any prior validation or sanitization. A malicious URL string crafted to trigger catastrophic backtracking in axios's internal regex parsing (e.g., related to header processing or URL components) can lead to a Denial of Service condition, locking up the Node.js event loop.",
  "impact_assessment": "High. Successful exploitation results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition, rendering the entire application unresponsive until the malicious request times out or the process is restarted. This affects application availability.",
  "code_paths_affected": [
    "server.js:57 (app.post('/api/fetch'))"
  ],
  "test_case": "POST /api/fetch\\nBody: { \"url\": \"http://example.com/path/to/exploit?q=[ReDoS_Payload]\" }\\n(Note: The specific ReDoS payload depends on the internal regex, but the vector is the user-controlled URL input.",
  "recommended_action": "Upgrade immediately",
